								<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
								<p>
                                    Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!<br>
                                    Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!<br>
                                    Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. <br>
                                    This case study focuses on using Foodie-Fi data; a subscription style digital data to answer important business questions that could help the startup have an insight of critical business metrics.<br><br>
									<u>Overall Goal</u>: Generate insights relating to customer journey, payment transactions, and overall business performance.<br>

									<p>Customer subscriptions show the exact date where their specific <code>plan_id</code> starts.</p>
									<p>If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription - the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over - the <code>start_date</code> in the <code>subscriptions</code> table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.</p>
									<p>When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or annual pro plan - the higher plan will take effect straightaway.</p>
									<p>When customers churn - they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period but the <code>start_date</code> will be technically the day they decided to cancel their service.</p>

									First I created the database using ERD and at the same time I familiarized myself with the data. Then connected the tables using Primary and Foreign Key constraints. And then used my quering skills to find answers.

									&emsp;On December 31, 2020, more people subscribed or upgraded to the pro monthly plan, but fewer people signed up for the trial plan. Could it be that some new customers signed up for paid plans immediately? If not, Foodie-Fi needs to scale up its marketing strategies for acquiring new sign-ups during this period as it’s a holiday period, and as an entertainment platform, it's supposed to have more customers testing out the platform.

								<!-- <h3 id="payment-questions">Payment Questions</h3>
								<p>
									The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new <code>payments</code> table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the <code>subscriptions</code> table with the following requirements:
									<li>monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original <code>start_date</code> of any monthly paid plan</li>
									<li>upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately</li>
									<li>upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period</li>
									<li>once a customer churns they will no longer make payments</li>
