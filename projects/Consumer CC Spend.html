								<p>
									This is a fictional dataset with details of sample 100 customers using different types of credit cards living in different cities, working different jobs in different companies.<br>
									<u>Overall Goal</u>: “Analyze the Consumer's credit card spending data and generate insights”<br>
									<u>Questions</u>: What is the average age of credit card holders?
													  What is the average credit limit?
													  Which is the most commonly held credit card type?
													  Which is the most common spending category?
													  What is the rate of late-paying customers? etc..<br>

								<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
								<p><u>Overview</u>: First I cleaned the data in Excel then I used MySQL Workbench (GUI of MySQL) to create a database and find the results of the queries. Then I used Power BI to create a dashboard to showcase all the metrics and analyze the data.</p>
								<h3 id="excel">Microsoft Excel</h3>
								<p>
									I started downloading the data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darpan25bajaj/credit-card-exploratory-data-analysis" class="link-highlight">Kaggle</a> and checked if there was any data that has to be cleaned. <br>
									The data was already clean but the company column had few incorrect values as in the customers whose job category was self employed had a name of company in company column so I replaced those values with "self employed".
								</p>
								<h3 id="sql">MySQL</h3>
								<p>
									First I created the database using ERD and exported all the CSV files to respective tables at the same time I familiarized myself with the data. Then connected the tables using Primary and Foreign Key constraints. And then used my quering skills to find answers.

								<p>
									I used Microsoft Power BI to showcase my analysis and metrics in a dashboard. <br>
									I created a new table to called <i>late_payment</i> to summarize every customers'  spending and repaying date to calculate the no. of days they took to repay their credit card bills. <br>
									I created four columns - <br>
									<b>•</b>&emsp;<i>customer_id</i> - to store customers' id. <br>
									<b>•</b>&emsp;<i>spend_date</i> - to store the last spending date. <br>
									<b>•</b>&emsp;<i>repayment_date</i> - to store the last bill payment date. <br>
									<b>•</b>&emsp;<i>days</i> - to store the no. of days they took to pay their bill.
									<md-block>
										```DAX
										late_payment = 
											SUMMARIZE(spend, spend[customer_id], "spend_date", MAX(spend[date]),
												"repayment_date", MAXX(FILTER(repayment, repayment[customer_id] = spend[customer_id]), repayment[date]),
												"days", ABS(DATEDIFF(MAX(repayment[date]), MAX(spend[date]),DAY))
											)</md-block>
									I could've imported the late payments table from sql but I wanted to work on my DAX querying skills. <br>
									Also I created a measure <i>%_late_payment</i> to calculate the rate of late paying customer considering the maximun no. of days to pay the bill is 30 days.
									<md-block>
										```DAX
										%_late_payment = COUNTROWS(FILTER(late_payment, late_payment[days] > 30)) / COUNTROWS(late_payment)</md-block>
