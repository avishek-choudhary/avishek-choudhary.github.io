								<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
								<p>
									<u>Here’s something about IBM</u>: IBM (International Business Machines Corporation), nicknamed Big Blue, is an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York and is present in over 175 countries. IBM is best known for producing and selling computer hardware and software, as well as cloud computing and data analytics. It is among the world’s largest employers, with over 297,900 employees worldwide in 2022.<br>
									<u>Why I chose this project</u>: Although this is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists (as claimed by the person who shared this data), I wanted to improve my dashboard creating and data analysis skill. Also this is the first time I did a project in this domain where I used my analytical skills to recommend strategies (see overall goal) based on the insights generated.<br>
									<u>Overall Goal</u>: “Recommend strategies to retain employee”<br>
									<u>Questions</u>: What is the average age of employees who left the company? What is the most common department for employees who left the company? What is the correlation between salary and attrition? What is the correlation between years of experience and attrition? What is the correlation between education level and attrition? What is the gender split of employee attrition? …etc.
								</p>
								<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
								<p><u>Overview</u>: The original data was cleaned in Microsoft Excel, then I used Microsoft Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. I used NovyPro to host the Power BI dashboard file.</p>
								<h3 id="excel">Microsoft Excel</h3>
								<p>I downloaded the csv file and converted it into spreadsheet to check if there was any garbage/null values but the data was already clean meanwhile I also familiarized myself with the data.<br>
									Below are the sample images of data column, there are total 35 columns it consists of both employee attrition and performance data.<br>

								<p>
									To view my complete dashboard click <a href="https://www.novypro.com/project/ibm-hr-analytics-dashboard" class="link-highlight" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
									My goal was to display all the key metrics leading to employee attrition in one screen.<br>
									While creating charts and cards, I faced a few problems like the values in attrition column had yes or no values so whenever I wanted to show the count of employee attrition I always had to apply filter for “yes” value so to tackle this problem I created a new column called Attrition with the values 1 and 0 to make it easy for counting this saved me some time and then I renamed the previous one as Attrition(Yes/No).<br><br>
									Added Columns:<br>
									<b>Attrition</b> – to store 1 for Yes and 0 for No w.r.t Attrition(Yes/No) column.<br>
									<b>Age Group</b> – to categorize the age in two groups “Adult” and “Senior”.<br>
									<b>Salary Slab</b> – to categorize the salaries- “Upto $5K”, “$5K-$10K”, “$10K-$20K”, “$20K+”.<br><br>
									I also created a measure:<br>
									<b>Attrition Rate</b> – to calculate the rate of attrition, please refer the formula below:<br>
									<code>Attrition Rate = 100 * Attrition / EmployeeCount</code><br><br>
									To make the dashboard interactive I added 3 slicers to filter the whole dashboard by: <br>
									<b>Department</b> – Human Resources, Research & Development and Sales.<br>
									<b>Gender</b> – Male and Female<br>
									<b>Age Range</b> – Although the age is categorized in Age Group column but I added this slicer so you can select an age range of your choice, you can select both upper and lower limit with the help of slider or enter it manually.
